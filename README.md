# Project Overview

This repository provides a comprehensive solution to the challenge by implementing each step in a series of Jupyter Notebook files. The program is designed for ease of use, with automatic data downloading and streamlined processing.

## Key Features
- **No manual data download or file path adjustments needed** – the program automatically retrieves the necessary data.
- **Step-by-step implementation** – each challenge question is addressed in a structured manner.
- **Efficient handling of duplicate transactions** – ensures data quality and accuracy.
- **Feature engineering for optimized model performance** – prepares data for predictive analysis.
- **Comprehensive modeling phase** – builds, trains, and evaluates a predictive model.

## Instructions
To run the program, execute the Jupyter Notebooks in the following order:

### 1. `0_loading_EDA.ipynb`
**Purpose:** Answers Question 1 (Load) and Question 2 (Plot).  
**What it does:**
- Loads the dataset from the provided GitHub repository.
- Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA), including plotting to meet challenge requirements.

### 2. `1_data_wrangling.ipynb`
**Purpose:** Answers Question 3 (Data Wrangling - Duplicate Transactions).  
**What it does:**
- Identifies and handles duplicate transactions in the dataset.

### 3. `2_feature_engineering.ipynb`
**Purpose:** Prepares data for Question 4 (Model).  
**What it does:**
- Engineers features required for modeling.
- Optimizes the dataset for efficient use in the modeling phase.

### 4. `3_modeling.ipynb`
**Purpose:** Answers Question 4 (Model).  
**What it does:**
- Builds, trains, and evaluates a predictive model using the prepared dataset.
- Provides detailed performance metrics and insights.
